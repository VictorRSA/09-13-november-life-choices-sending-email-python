mport yagmail
yag = yagmail.SMTP()
contents = [
    "This is the body, and here is just text http://somedomain/image.png",
    "You can find an audio file attached.", '/local/path/to/song.mp3'
]
yag.send('to@someone.com', 'subject', contents)

# Alternatively, with a simple one-liner:
yagmail.SMTP('mygmailusername').send('to@someone.com', 'subject', contents)

Note that yagmail will read the password securely from your keyring, see the section on Username and Password in the repository’s README for further details. If you do not want this, you can initialize yagmail.SMTP like this:

yag = yagmail.SMTP('mygmailusername', 'mygmailpassword')

but honestly, do you want to have your password written in your script?
